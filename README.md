`kk` is a new `ls` substitute for `zsh` forked from `k`.



[kk](https://github.com/dongminkim/kk) is a project that seek to aggressively refactor [k](https://github.com/supercrabtree/k)* in order to:

- Improve execution speed
- Improve compatibilities with the genuine `ls`
- Improve user experiences
